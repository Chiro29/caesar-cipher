# Caesar cipher

A simple encryption code, using the Caesar cipher technique with Ruby. 
You can choose to write anything, as long as it is in characters and spaces, you can decide the number for the position of each character, and you can choose if you want to encrypt it or decrypt it.
Edit

If you don't know how Caesar's cipher works, there's a video of Harvard's CS50 talking about the [Caesar cipher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36xNpbosfTY).
